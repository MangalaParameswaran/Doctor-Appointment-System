<h1>👩‍⚕️ Doctor Appointment App 👨‍⚕️
</h1>
Excited to share my recent project, a comprehensive Doctor Appointment App developed using Redux, React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. 🚀

This application serves as a seamless platform for booking doctor appointments, featuring both frontend and backend functionalities. Users can easily browse available appointments, check their availability, and book appointments with their preferred doctors.

<b>Key Features:</b>

Appointment Booking: Users can browse through available appointments and book slots according to their convenience.
Admin Approval: The app facilitates two types of users - regular users and doctors. Regular users can apply to become doctors, and upon admin verification and approval, they gain access to doctor functionalities.
Doctor Verification: Admins have the authority to verify and approve user applications for doctor roles, ensuring credibility and professionalism within the app.
Frontend & Backend Integration: Seamlessly integrated frontend and backend components to provide a cohesive user experience.
Responsive Design: Implemented Bootstrap for a responsive and mobile-friendly UI, ensuring accessibility across various devices.
Deployment:
Frontend: Doctor Appointment App

This project was a fantastic opportunity to combine my expertise in Redux, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB to create a practical solution addressing the crucial need for efficient doctor appointment management. I thoroughly enjoyed working on the intricate functionalities and collaborating with a dynamic team to bring this project to fruition.

Feel free to explore the deployed app and let me know your thoughts! I'm open to any feedback or inquiries regarding the project. 📩
